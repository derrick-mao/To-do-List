## Project Description
### Why?
* Task management is a universal requirement.  Everyone, from students to professionals rely on task management to organize thier day to day life and achieve productivity.  We aim to create an application that   retains the use of a basic to-do list while introducing features that modern users desire, enabling them to manage their tasks more effectively and intuitively.

  
### Tools to use
* Languages: C++
* Tools: GitHub (for version control and collaboration), QT (software used to develop GUIs)
* Technologies/Frameworks: QT framework to create an interface that displays the task manager

  
### Inputs and Outputs

* Task details (title, description, priority, due date)
* User actions (add, delete, mark as complete, edit)

Output:
* List of tasks due for current day and upcoming days
* List of tasks ordered from high to low priority
* List of completed tasks

  
### Features
