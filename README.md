## Project Description
### Why?
* Task management is a universal requirement.  Everyone, from students to professionals rely on task management to organize thier day to day life and achieve productivity.  We aim to create an application that   retains the use of a basic to-do list while introducing features that modern users desire, enabling them to manage thier tasks more effectively and intuitively.
### Tools to use
* Languages: C++
* Tools: GitHub (for version control and collaboration), QT (software used to develop GUIs)
* Technologies/Frameworks: QT framework to create an interface that displays the task manager
### Inputs and Outputs
Input:
* Task details (title, description, priority, due date)
* User actions (add, delete, mark as complete, edit)

Output:
* List of tasks for current day and upcoming days
* List of completed tasks
* Feedback messages after actions (e.g., "Task added successfully!")
### Features

* Add Tasks: With fields for title, due date, priority, notes, and categories/tags.
* Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.
* Mark as Complete: Allows users to track their progress.

 ## Testing
 A [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xxnJyCJz1eDI3-EXb4G7AvZ5np_LuSaxOAiUBP3dAu0/edit) to a document that shows how we used the built-in QT Creator GDB debugger to test our code.
 

 ## Installation/Usage
 Download the ZIP file of our repository, and you will see that there is a "build" folder. Open that folder and run todoApp.exe and the application should run perfectly!
